%%%                        Turing's secret work at Bletchley Park during
%%%                        the 1939--1945 war was extremely important,
%%%                        but was classified by the British Official
%%%                        Secrets Act for fifty years after the war.

%%%                        It is a human tragedy, and a tremendous loss
%%%                        to science, that this great individual who
%%%                        had contributed so much to science, and, in
%%%                        secret, to the winning of the Second World
%%%                        War, was after the War treated so badly by
%%%                        society, that he was eventually driven to
%%%                        suicide.  See entry Brown:2009:TAT for a
%%%                        belated apology and recognition by the
%%%                        British government.
%%%
%%%                        In his 1970 ACM Turing Award Lecture (cited
%%%                        below), Jim Wilkinson, who worked closely
%%%                        with Turing from 1946 to 1948, wrote this
%%%                        about Turing:
%%%
%%%                            ``However, I feel bound to say that his
%%%                            published work fails to give an adequate
%%%                            impression of his remarkable versatility
%%%                            as a mathematician. His knowledge ranged
%%%                            widely over the whole field of pure and
%%%                            applied mathematics and seemed, as it
%%%                            were, not merely something he had learned
%%%                            from books, but to form an integral part
%%%                            of the man himself. One could scarcely
%%%                            imagine that he would ever `forget' any
%%%                            of it. In spite of this he had only
%%%                            twenty published papers to his credit
%%%                            (and this only if one includes virtually
%%%                            everything), written over a period of
%%%                            some twenty years. Remarkable as some of
%%%                            these papers are, this work represents a
%%%                            mere fraction of what he might have done
%%%                            if things had turned out just a little
%%%                            differently.''
%%%
%%%                            ``... A second factor limiting his output
%%%                            was a marked disinclination to put pen to
%%%                            paper. At school he is reputed to have
%%%                            had little enthusiasm for the `English
%%%                            subjects' and he seemed to find the
%%%                            tedium of publishing a paper even more
%%%                            oppressive than most of us do.''
%%%
%%%                        Wilkinson also reported:
%%%
%%%                            ``It is perhaps salutary to be reminded
%%%                            that as early as 1946 Turing had
%%%                            considered the possibility of working
%%%                            with both interval and significant digit
%%%                            arithmetic and the report recalled
%%%                            forgotten conversations, not to mention
%%%                            heated arguments, which we had on this
%%%                            topic.''
%%%
%%%                        Harry D. Huskey (cited below) recalled:
%%%
%%%                            ``That spring Turing was asked to give a
%%%                            series of lectures to the people at the
%%%                            Ministry of Supply. Leslie Fox (who
%%%                            worked on relaxation methods), Wilkinson,
%%%                            and I rode up to London with Turing. On
%%%                            the way we talked about design
%%%                            problems. I can remember discussing
%%%                            rounding of floating point numbers and
%%%                            Turing becoming so upset that he could
%%%                            hardly give his lecture.''

%%%                            The Bletchley Park Trust has successfully
%%%                            purchased a collection of Alan Turing's
%%%                            most important works due to an online
%%%                            campaign to raise the funds, which
%%%                            included a $100,000 donation from Google.
%%%                            The collection consists of 15 of Turing's
%%%                            18 published papers, including his first
%%%                            published paper and his preliminary plans
%%%                            for computing and artificial
%%%                            intelligence.  The campaign was led by
%%%                            Bletchley Park Trust CEO Simon Greenish.
%%%                            The documents will be placed in a secure,
%%%                            climate-controlled section of Bletchley
%%%                            and will go on display in the coming
%%%                            months.  The National Heritage Memorial
%%%                            Fund (NHMF) ``was set up in memory of
%%%                            those who have given their lives for the
%%%                            UK, and this grant will now ensure that
%%%                            this extremely rare collection of
%%%                            Turing's work stands as a permanent
%%%                            memorial to the man and to all those who
%%%                            paid the ultimate price in service to
%%%                            this nation,'' says NFMF chairman Dame
%%%                            Jenny Abramsky.

                 months. As well as consulting the publicly available
                 archives, Lewin has talked to many people involved in
                 the war, so it's an authoritative treatment. Good
                 \cite[p. 216]{Britton:1992:CWM} says ``Michael Howard,
                 Chichele professor of the history of war at Oxford, is
                 right when he says that this [Lewin's book] is `perhaps
                 the most important book to have appeared on the Second
                 World War since Chester Wilmot wrote \emph{The Struggle
                 for Europe} a quarter of a century ago'.'' Notes below
                 are verbatim or paraphrased: pp. 20--21: As long as
                 Germans had confidence in their ciphers (never lost,
                 despite inquiries --- pp. 212--213) high-level
                 communication was conducted over the air waves. p. 22:
                 About 100,000 Enigmas were constructed during the war.
                 pp. 57--59 mention Turing. I. J. Good quoted: `My
                 impression is that Turing's idea was one that might not
                 have been thought of by anyone else for a long time and
                 it greatly increased the power of the bombe.' p. 206:
                 U-boat 110 was abandoned after attack by the destroyer
                 Bulldog. The self-destruction explosives failed to go
                 off. The sub was boarded and codebooks (valid for
                 several weeks to come), charts and Enigma recovered! p.
                 231: Re. D-day: the approach routes to the beaches were
                 changed more than once in light of the latest
                 intelligence available. Shipping losses were
                 infinitesimal. p. 321: The Abwehr spy-masters were
                 telling their `agents' in London to report both the
                 time and the place of flying-bomb explosions in London.
                 Crisis: if double-agents reported falsely they might be
                 unveiled. Yet didn't want to give accurate reports.
                 Answer: reported back actual point of strike for bombs
                 that overshot London linked with the actual time of
                 strike for bombs that had fallen short. Germans lacked
                 photo-reconnaissance and cut the mean range back -
                 saved thousands of lives. p. 348: Arnhem: Ultra
                 provided info about movement of German HQ to near
                 Arnhem that could have alerted allies to the danger.
                 `The puzzling fact that the signal was sent out from
                 Bletchley with a low ZZ priority cannot, in itself,
                 account for its failure to set alarm-bells ringing.'

                 that euphoria has affected judgement. Ultra and other
                 evidence not properly evaluated/accepted. At least one
                 person realised the danger (pp. 35--51), but his

                 the University of Toronto. Turing has been in use since

                 machines.\par

                 for numerical calculations. The important new features

                 convenient functions for directed roundings and

                 Stephen Tindall as Turing. Just over 2 hours. It
                 managed to mention most of the key points about
                 Turing's life, if only briefly, but concentrated mainly
                 on his homosexuality, with more explicit detail than I
                 thought necessary. Nothing on the process of code
                 breaking. Tindall was quite good, but didn't try the
                 high pitched laugh and no doubt has a deeper, more
                 resonant voice and puts the speeches across better than
                 Turing would have.",

                 research into means for improving the dependability of

                 in the ``Crane Collection''. Written at the time of his

                 Enter one Joe Desch, an unassuming but brilliant
                 engineer at the National Cash Register Company in
                 Dayton, Ohio, who was given the task of creating a
                 machine to break the new Enigma settings. It was an
                 enterprise that rivaled the Manhattan Project for
                 secrecy and complexity---and nearly drove Desch to a
                 breakdown. Under enormous pressure, he succeeded in
                 creating a 5,000-pound electromechanical monster known
                 as the Desch Bombe, which helped turn the tide in the
                 Battle of the Atlantic---but not before a disgruntled
                 co-worker attempted to leak information about the
                 machine to the Nazis.

                 After toiling anonymously---it even took his daughter
                 years to learn of his accomplishments---Desch was
                 awarded the National Medal of Merit, the country's
                 highest civilian honor. In The Secret in Building 26,
                 the entire thrilling story of the final triumph over
                 Enigma is finally told. ''",

                 memory for holding instructions and data, and to

                 an imaginary computer known as the Turing Machine; in
                 an age before computers, he explored the concept of
                 what it meant to be computable, creating the field of
                 computability theory in the process, a foundation of
                 present-day computer programming. The book expands
                 Turing's original 36-page paper with additional
                 background chapters and extensive annotations; the
                 author elaborates on and clarifies many of Turing's
                 statements, making the original difficult-to-read
                 document accessible to present day programmers,
                 computer science majors, math geeks, and others.
                 Interwoven into the narrative are the highlights of
                 Turing's own life: his years at Cambridge and
                 Princeton, his secret work in cryptanalysis during
                 World War II, his involvement in seminal computer
                 projects, his speculations about artificial
                 intelligence, his arrest and prosecution for the crime
                 of ``gross indecency,'' and his early death by apparent
                 suicide at the age of 41.''",

                 a bar on the Illinois--Iowa border, John Vincent
                 Atanasoff, a professor of physics at Iowa State
                 University, after a frustrating day performing tedious
                 mathematical calculations in his lab, hit on the idea
                 that the binary number system and electronic switches,
                 combined with an array of capacitors on a moving drum
                 to serve as memory, could yield a computing machine
                 that would make his life easier. Then he went back and
                 built the machine. It worked, but he never patented the
                 device, and the developers of the far-better-known
                 ENIAC almost certainly stole critical ideas from him.
                 But in 1973 a court declared that the patent on that
                 Sperry Rand device was invalid, opening the gates to
                 the computer revolution. Biographer Jane Smiley makes
                 the race to develop digital computing as gripping as a

                 theorem: by updating our initial beliefs with objective
                 new information, we get a new and improved belief. To
                 its adherents, it is an elegant statement about
                 learning from experience. To its opponents, it is
                 subjectivity run amok. In the first-ever account of
                 Bayes' rule for general readers, Sharon Bertsch
                 McGrayne explores this controversial theorem and the
                 human obsessions surrounding it. She traces its
                 discovery by an amateur mathematician in the 1740s
                 through its development into roughly its modern form by
                 French scientist Pierre Simon Laplace. She reveals why
                 respected statisticians rendered it professionally
                 taboo for 150 years --- at the same time that
                 practitioners relied on it to solve crises involving
                 great uncertainty and scanty information, even breaking
                 Germany's Enigma code during World War II, and explains
                 how the advent of off-the-shelf computer technology in
                 the 1980s proved to be a game-changer. Today, Bayes'
                 rule is used everywhere from DNA de-coding to Homeland
                 Security. Drawing on primary source material and
                 interviews with statisticians and other scientists, The
                 Theory That Would Not Die is the riveting account of
                 how a seemingly simple theorem ignited one of the

                 one of the greatest scientists and thinkers of the 20th
                 century. Now well known for his crucial wartime role in
                 breaking the ENIGMA code, he was the first to conceive
                 of the fundamental principle of the modern computer ---
                 the idea of controlling a computing machine's
                 operations by means of coded instructions, stored in
                 the machine's `memory'. In 1945, Turing drew up his
                 revolutionary design for an electronic computing
                 machine --- his Automatic Computing Engine (`ACE'). A
                 pilot model of the ACE ran its first programme in 1950
                 and the production version, the `DEUCE', went on to
                 become a cornerstone of the fledgling British computer
                 industry. The first `personal' computer was based on
                 Turing's ACE. This book describes Turing's struggle to
                 build the modern computer. It contains first-hand
                 accounts by Turing and by the pioneers of computing who
                 worked with him. The book describes the hardware and
                 software of the ACE and contains chapters describing
                 Turing's path-breaking research in the fields of
                 Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Artificial Life
